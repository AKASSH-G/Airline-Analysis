# Airline-Analysis

Here I have done airline analysis using Power BI to provide insights and recommendations related to airline operations. Here I created dashboards and reports that provide a comprehensive view of airline operations, passenger travel reports on who came and went out of India, passenger demand, revenue performance, and market trends. I analyze complex data sets, identify patterns and trends, and develop insights that drive business decisions.
